# Face_Detection
Face Detection using Machine Learning Models: OpenCV and Mediapipe

This program detects your face using 5 dots, which are placed on key areas of the face. (nose, eyes, etc.)

# How it works?

* In this program, we are using a package called 'Mediapipe' which is an ML package useful for computer vision tasks
* We also are using OpenCv, or 'cv2', to make the frame capturing our face.
* The program then detects our face and continously tracks its movement using 5 dots.
* Can track a static image (paste image file into dedicated area) or webcam feed

# What is needed to run it...

* You will need to install both the OpenCV and Mediapipe python packages
* Can do so in the terminal by pasting these command lines: "pip install opencv-python" and "pip install mediapipe"

# Thank you
